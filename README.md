# Linux Notes
For the basic [or infuriating] linux details I constantly find myself needing.

## Searching the File System

### Find
example: `find ./ -name "fishguy*"

## Makemkv
when copying fails, delete the files in the Downloads folder using find and then download the latest version following the instructions on this page: https://makemkv.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=224

## Text Editors
### Nano
* Cut: 		`Ctrl + k`
* copy: 	`Alt + ^` i.e. `Alt + Shift + 6`
* paste 	`Ctrl + u`
* save: 	`Ctrl + o`
* select all: `Alt + a`

### Vim
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! [loads a bullet, spins the chamber.]
